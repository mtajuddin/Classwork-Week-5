//Why declare the variable type after you assigned the value?
//It doesn't matter.

//How can I change the background color everytime the snake eats food?
//At first I tried to just input random into the if statements for the instructions for getting food.
//This only would make the background flash when the snake got the food.
//I then noticed that the background's value in the draw function weren't changing and I reasoned this was keeping the color white.
//I then created variables with random numbers and placed them into the r, g, and b values for background.
//This allowed for the background to take different values.

//What values should I use for my if statement?
//nextX and nextY - Their value changes in relation to the snake's movement.
